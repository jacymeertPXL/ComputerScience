                    A small and quiet Hobbit from Bag End, Frodo is entrusted to bring the One Ring to Mount Doom and
                    destroy it
                    forever. In spite of his noble spirit, he starts to feel the terrible powers of the One Ring and the
                    danger of
                    the
                    fearsome creatures who hunt him. With the help of his friends in the Fellowship, Frodo must bravely

                    heavy
                    burden to save Middle-earth.

                    One Ring from Frodo and wield its powers to protect Gondor.

                    An Elven Prince, Legolas joined the Fellowship as a representative of his people. His agility and

                    archery
                    is unmatched. Because of the old feud between Elves and Dwarves, Legolas and Gimli are often found
                    trying to
                    outdo
                    each other.

                    As a representative of the Dwarves, Gimli is a mighty warrior always ready to draw his broad axes in

                    is
                    proud and strong. Gimli is not particularly good at riding horses and dislikes being tossed
                    around—except when
                    absolutely necessary.
