Caitlyn, a talented artificer, has spent the last 12 years working diligently under [[Nicholas van Myra]] in his renowned shop. Though skilled in her craft, she carries a shy and reserved nature that often keeps her from pursuing her desires. Caitlyn harbors a secret she has yet to share with othersâ€”she is a lesbian and has developed a deep crush on [[Zerc]], a member of the infamous Gambling Phoenix Crew [[The Crew]].

Despite her yearning to embark on a pirate adventure, Caitlyn's shyness holds her back from expressing her true aspirations. Instead, she finds solace in her work, pouring her heart and soul into crafting intricate inventions and creations. Caitlyn's talent and dedication have earned her the respect and admiration of her mentor, Nicholas, who recognizes her potential to forge her own path.

Within the walls of Nicholas' shop, Caitlyn dreams of the vast open seas and the thrill of joining a pirate crew. Yet, her timidity prevents her from mustering the courage to approach Zerc or express her longing for a life of adventure. She finds herself lost in the labyrinth of her own thoughts and desires, silently yearning for a connection that seems just out of reach.
