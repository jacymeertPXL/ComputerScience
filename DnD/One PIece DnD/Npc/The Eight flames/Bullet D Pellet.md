Bullet had dark black hair in a pixie cut with a single earring hanging from one ear. On her face she had a scar that runs across her nose, and her arms were covered in tattoos. She wore a red crop top exposing her midriff, a padded black vest, a pair of boots and black gloves. Her baggy black pants were held up by a wide brown belt. She also carried four pistols on her person.

She is also one of the yonko commanders of the  leviathan crew [[Party Friends leviathan crew]]
