- _ctrl+s_: this is used to save the changes to the same file.
    
- _ctrl+o_: this is used to save the changes to another filename. This will prompt for a filename and will overwrite the file if a file with the same name already exists.
    
- _ctrl+x_: quit the text editor and go back to the prompt. When you made changes to the file you will be asked if you want to save the changes and ifso you will have to enter a filename and press enter. It will overwrite the file if a file with the same name already exists.
    
- _shift+arrows_: select a portion of the text.
    
- _ctrl+k_: cut selected text or the whole line (if no text is selected).
    
- _ctrl+u_: paste any cut content.
    
- _ctrl+w_: find a certain text in the file (ctrl+q to search in the opposite direction).
    
- _ctrl+\_: search and replace - give the word to search for and then give the word to replace it with (then use yes, no, all, ...) (you can type ctrl+< )
    
- _ctrl+/_: goto a certain line (and column). (you can also type _ctrl+-_)
    
- _alt+u_: undo the last change.
    
- _alt+e_: redo the last change.
    
- _alt+s_: enable/disable auto wrap text over lines.
    
- _alt+n_: show/hide line numbers.
    
- _ctrl+home_: goto first line
    
- _ctrl+end_: goto last line

If you want to cut a specific text you can select it first by pressing _shift+arrow keys_. Then use _ctrl+k_ to cut and afterwards _ctrl+u_ to paste.

The fastest way to 'save and quit nano' is to type _ctrl+s_ (to save the changes) followed by _ctrl+x_ (to exit nano).
