-One common use of `cp` is to make a second copy of the source file in the same directory. Supply a different name for the copy to differentiate it from the original. A common convention is to add an extra extension such as `.bak` or `.cp` to the existing file name. For example, a standard name for a backup copy of `archive.txt` is `archive.txt.bak`.
