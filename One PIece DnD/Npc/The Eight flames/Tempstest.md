She appears to be a middle aged woman with glasses who has short white hair, clothes that seem like they're made of weather patterns, and wears a silver candle around her neck. She wields a staff with lighting bolts around its end.

Tempest seems to be an intelligent, serious woman. However she does share a flirty nature with Hemlock. She likes to keep a journal of puns. Her main flaw is that she has pretty bad wisdom saves.
