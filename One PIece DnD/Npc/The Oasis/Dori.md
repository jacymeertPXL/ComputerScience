Dori, a young boy with the Ink Ink Devil Fruit, possesses a unique ability that allows his drawings to come to life. However, he struggles with controlling these ink creatures, as he cannot dictate their actions. Tragically, Dori fell into the clutches of a band of ruthless bandits who exploited his powers, forcing him to create ink monsters that wreaked havoc upon cities. The torturous experiences and immense stress took a toll on him, ultimately blinding him. Now, with a blindfold covering his sightless eyes, he finds himself imprisoned within the city walls.

Confined and trapped in his own darkness, Dori's spirit remained resilient. Despite the hardships he endured, he clung to the flickering hope that someday he would be free from the bandits' control. It was during this desperate time that the players, driven by a sense of justice and compassion, discovered his plight and resolved to rescue him.

Venturing into the heart of the city, the players confronted the bandits, engaging in a fierce battle to free Dori from his captors' grasp. The ink monsters he unwittingly created fought alongside him, their actions guided by an instinctual bond he shared with them. The players' combined strength and strategic prowess overcame the bandits, setting Dori free from his tormentors.

In the aftermath of the rescue, Dori, initially wary and fearful, gradually realized the players' genuine intentions. They saw beyond his affliction and recognized his innate potential. Touched by their kindness and determined to forge a new path, Dori made the heartfelt decision to join the players' crew.

Within the crew, Dori found solace and a sense of belonging he had yearned for since the bandits had twisted his powers for their nefarious purposes. Despite his blindness, Dori's remaining senses sharpened, allowing him to perceive the world in different ways. The crew welcomed him with open arms, embracing his unique abilities and understanding the burden he carried.

As they set sail on their adventures, Dori's ink creations took on new forms, now under his gentle guidance and control. Together, the crew navigated the seas, their diverse skills and talents harmonizing in the face of danger. Dori's drawings brought forth not only powerful allies but also beautiful works of art that brought joy and inspiration to those they encountered.

While Dori's blindness remained a physical limitation, it did not hinder his spirit. Instead, he found strength in his other senses and the unwavering support of his newfound crewmates. They became his eyes, describing the vibrant world around them, and together they forged a bond that transcended sight.

In joining the crew, Dori not only found liberation from his past torment but also discovered a new purpose. With his unique abilities, he became an invaluable asset, bringing both wonder and protection to the crew. United by their shared journey and determination to make amends for the darkness that had consumed Dori's life, they set forth, ready to face the challenges that lay ahead and create a future where his ink would leave a legacy of hope and creativity.

Dori, the young boy with the Ink Ink Devil Fruit and a tragic past, held another significant connection in his life. He was the little brother of [[Roulette]], the boss of Oasis
