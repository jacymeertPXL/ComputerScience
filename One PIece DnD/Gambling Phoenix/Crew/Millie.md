Meet Millie, a courageous pirate who was once enslaved but rescued by her captain, for whom she would now give her life. Hailing from the rare and persecuted Lunarian race, Millie possesses a unique ability to manipulate and weaponize fire, making her a formidable force in combat.

The Lunarians, a race on the brink of extinction, possess the incredible power to emit and control fire from their bodies. Millie's flames can be unleashed in a variety of ways, from devastating fire blasts and gatling-like attacks to imbuing her limbs and weapons with fiery energy, enhancing the potency of her melee strikes. She can even shape her flames into formidable constructs, including massive fiery explosions. Millie's flames burn with such intensity that they can resemble molten magma, showcasing the true strength of her Lunarian heritage. However, the potential drawbacks or limitations of excessive fire usage remain unknown.

Having experienced the horrors of slavery firsthand, Millie's devotion to her captain and crew runs deep. Her captain's act of saving her from a life of bondage has forged an unbreakable bond of loyalty and gratitude within her heart. Millie dedicates her life to protecting and supporting her crew, valuing the importance of unity and trust among them. She fights with unwavering determination, drawing upon her Lunarian flames to defend those she holds dear and to stand against the injustices of the world.

Millie's personal quest is twofold: to seek vengeance against those responsible for her enslavement and to find her lost brother, who was also taken by the slave trade. The pain of their separation fuels her drive, propelling her through treacherous waters and dangerous encounters. Millie's unwavering resolve and relentless pursuit of her brother serve as a beacon of hope for others who have suffered the same fate, inspiring them to never give up in the face of adversity.

As Millie sails the seas as a pirate, her Lunarian heritage and fiery abilities make her a force to be reckoned with. Her determination to protect her crew and reunite with her brother paints her as a fierce warrior and a steadfast ally. In a world that often marginalizes her race, Millie fights for justice, striving to create a future where the Lunarians and all oppressed individuals can live in freedom and harmony.
