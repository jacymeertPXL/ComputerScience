                    it forever. In
                    spite of his noble spirit, he starts to feel the terrible powers of the One Ring and the danger of

                    fearsome
                    creatures who hunt him. With the help of his friends in the Fellowship, Frodo must bravely carry

                    heavy burden to
                    save Middle-earth.</p>

                    of Gondor as

                    throne of
                    Gondor. Masterful with the sword, this great warrior leads the Fellowship of the Ring when Gandalf

                    Grey
                    was defeated

                <p>An Elven Prince, Legolas joined the Fellowship as a representative of his people. His agility and

                    in
                    archery is
                    unmatched. Because of the old feud between Elves and Dwarves, Legolas and Gimli are often found
                    trying
                    to
                    outdo each

                    He is proud
                    and strong. Gimli is not particularly good at riding horses and dislikes being tossed around—except

                    absolutely
                    necessary.</p>
